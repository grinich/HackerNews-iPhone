:::::::::::::   FORMATTING   ::::::::::::::::


Blank lines separate paragraphs.
Text after a blank line that is indented by two or more spaces is reproduced verbatim. (This is intended for code.)

Text surrounded by asterisks is italicized, if the character after the first asterisk isn't whitespace.

Urls become links, except in the text field of a submission.












:::::::::::::   MASK USER AGENT   ::::::::::::::::

NSString *agentString = @"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/525.27.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.1 Safari/525.27.1";
		
NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL: 
[NSURL URLWithString:urlString]];
[request setValue:agentString forHTTPHeaderField:@"User-Agent"];
