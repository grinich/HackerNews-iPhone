:::::::::::::   FORMATTING   ::::::::::::::::


Blank lines separate paragraphs.
Text after a blank line that is indented by two or more spaces is reproduced verbatim. (This is intended for code.)

Text surrounded by asterisks is italicized, if the character after the first asterisk isn't whitespace.

Urls become links, except in the text field of a submission.





:::::::::::::   BUGS   ::::::::::::::::

Error when parsing out characters that *should* have been escaped in good HTML.

INFO [index: 17816]: Unable to parse '& kit</a' as entity

Some of this stuff parses incorrectly. "Jay Leno's ..." --> "Jay Leno√¢s ..."
